# DS340W-project-flower-image-classification

The small, limited dataset used in the paper paper contains all the images under the file images and are split into train, test, and val. Ignore the other random images (I am trying to delete these). 

The full dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition  
The parent paper used for this research is: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03056 
The file name I chose for the full dataset is 'flowers'. 


I plan to update the transfer model for my research project. The file I described in the implementation video is FlowerTransferLearning.i
